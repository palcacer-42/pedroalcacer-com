## Historical Instruments

Pedro Alcàcer plays a variety of early music instruments, each with its own unique sound and history.

### Renaissance Lute

The Renaissance lute is a plucked string instrument with a distinctive pear-shaped body. It was the primary polyphonic instrument of the Renaissance period.

### Baroque Lute

The Baroque lute evolved from the Renaissance lute, featuring additional courses and different tuning systems to accommodate the musical demands of Baroque composers.

### Theorbo

The theorbo is a large plucked string instrument used primarily as a continuo instrument in Baroque music, supporting harmonic progression in ensemble and vocal music.

### Vihuela

The Spanish vihuela was the predecessor to the modern guitar, popular during the Renaissance in Spain and Portugal.

### Arciliuto

The arciliuto is an Italian Baroque lute variant that combines features of both the lute and theorbo, used in both solo and ensemble music.

Each instrument has been carefully selected and maintained to achieve authentic historical sound and performance practice.
