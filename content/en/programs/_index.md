  - title: "The Art of the Bow"
    description: |
      The seventeenth-century solo violin repertoire is one of the most interesting and virtuosic of its time. Germany, with its stylus fantasticus, was one of the most prolific countries in this field. Biber, Pisendel, and Bach are some of the greatest exponents of this style. With this program, I would like to show the different forms of composition for solo violin used by these composers.
  - title: "Complete Sonatas for Violin and Harpsichord by J.S. Bach"
    description: |
      The six sonatas for violin and obbligato harpsichord, BWV 1014-1019, are some of the most beautiful and complex chamber music works by J.S. Bach. With a wide variety of styles and forms, they are a challenge for any performer. In this program, I will perform the complete set of sonatas, a real journey through the music of the great master.
  - title: "The Violin in the Time of Louis XIV"
    description: |
      The French court of Louis XIV was one of the most important cultural centers of its time. Music was an essential part of courtly life, and the violin played a fundamental role in it. In this program, I will perform a selection of works by the most important French composers of the time, such as Lully, Marais, and Leclair.
  - title: "The Italian Violin"
    description: |
      Italy was the cradle of the violin, and its composers were the first to explore the technical and expressive possibilities of the instrument. In this program, I will perform a selection of works by the most important Italian composers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, such as Corelli, Vivaldi, and Tartini.
